# BSP Releases
There are four BSP packages here.  The two with "base" in the name are stripped to
just the ZynqMP design with no bitstream.  The other two include some PL functionality.
There is a 4 GByte and 8 GByte version of each BSP that should be selected based
on the board that is being targeted.
