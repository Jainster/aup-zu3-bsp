# BSP Releases
There are four TCL scripts to build designs here.  The two with "base" in the name are stripped to
just the ZynqMP design.  The other two include some PL functionality.
There is a 4 GByte and 8 GByte version of each hardware design that should be selected based
on the board that is being targeted.
